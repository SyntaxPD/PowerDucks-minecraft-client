[0211/142512:INFO:GameCallbacks.cpp(178)] game/FML (Client thread) warn * A broken ore dictionary registration with name ingotMeteoricIron has occurred. It adds an item (type: class micdoodle8.mods.galacticraft.core.items.ItemMoon) which is currently unknown to the game registry. This dictionary item can only support a single value when registered with ores like this, and NO I am not going to turn this spam off. Just register your ore dictionary entries after the GameRegistry.
TO USERS: YES this is a BUG in the mod Galacticraft Core report it to them!
